## SaaS Project: Android Assistant + OpenClaw Gateway

### Concept
Replace Google Assistant/Gemini with a custom Android app backed by OpenClaw gateway. Target both phone and Android Auto.

### Business Model
- **App**: Free
- **Hosted Gateway**: Subscription-based service
  - Free tier: Local gateway only (user's own OpenClaw instance)
  - Paid tiers: Managed OpenClaw gateway with usage limits

### Tech Stack
- **Android**: Kotlin + Jetpack Compose + Android Auto (MediaBrowserService)
- **Backend**: OpenClaw Gateway (existing, no custom backend needed)
- **Hosting**: Fly.io or Railway for Docker containers
- **Payments**: Stripe
- **Auth**: Supabase Auth

### Architecture
1. Android App captures voice
2. Sends to OpenClaw Gateway (local or hosted)
3. Gateway processes via AI agents
4. Returns response to app for TTS

### Why This Works
- Android Auto is underserved — Google Assistant barely works in cars
- Privacy angle: Local gateway option
- Recurring revenue from hosted gateway service
- OpenClaw ecosystem integration

### What Needs Building
- Android app (Kotlin + Jetpack Compose)
- Android Auto module
- Stripe billing integration
- Self-hosted gateway provisioner
- User account system

### Status
- Idea generation phase
- Waiting to start implementation

### Notes
- User wants to use OpenClaw gateway as backend (no custom backend needed)
- Main complexity is Android Auto integration (media-style app for voice controls)
